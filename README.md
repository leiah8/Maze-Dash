# Maze-Dash
# This is the first version of the game Maze Dash
# A maze is randomly generated and the user must navigate their way through as the time runs out using the arrow and/or AWSD keys
# There are also obstacles such as lasers and slamming walls that cause the time to go faster when the user is being attacked
# There is a multi-player and single player version
