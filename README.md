# Maze-Dash
This is the first version of the game Maze Dash. Therefore, many improvements are yet to be made. 

A maze is randomly generated and the user must navigate their way through as the time runs out using the arrow and/or AWSD keys.
There are also obstacles such as lasers and slamming walls that cause the time to go faster when the user is being attacked.
There is a multi-player and single player version.
